                <h1> SQUAT</h1>
                <p>The squat is a dynamic strength training exercise that requires several muscles in your upper and lower body to work together simultaneously.

                     Many of these muscles help power you through daily tasks such as walking, climbing stairs, bending, or carrying heavy loads. They also help you perform athletic-related activities.
                    
                    Adding squats to your workouts can help boost your exercise performance, decrease your risk of injury, and keep you moving more easily throughout the day. But these are just a few of the benefits.</p>
             <p>
